# Compiler with JFlex and Cup
## Overview:
The Compiler project is a comprehensive compiler implementation developed using Java, CUP, and JFlex. This project aims to create a compiler from scratch, incorporating new grammatical and syntactic rules. The compiler performs lexical and syntactic analysis, detects errors in the source code, conducts semantic analysis, generates intermediate code, and finally translates the intermediate code into assembly (ASM) code.

## Purpose:
The primary objective of the Compiler project is to provide a robust and customizable compiler solution. By implementing new grammatical and syntactic rules, this project aims to explore the flexibility and extensibility of compiler design. Additionally, the project serves as a learning platform for understanding the intricacies of compiler construction and optimization.

## Features:
- Lexical and Syntactic Analysis: Perform thorough lexical and syntactic analysis of the source code.
- Error Detection: Identify and report any errors present in the source code.
- Semantic Analysis: Conduct semantic analysis to ensure logical correctness and consistency.
- Intermediate Code Generation: Generate intermediate code representing the analyzed source code.
- Assembly Code Translation: Translate the intermediate code into assembly (ASM) code for execution.
## Usage:
To utilize the Zero Compiler, clone this repository and follow the setup instructions provided in the documentation. Once set up, you can run the compiler on a target source code file to perform lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis. Additionally, you can generate intermediate code and assembly code for further processing and execution.
